SwishWings WIP :eyes:
TL;DR Dual Hand Gesture sensor computer/HID interface
SwishWings is a set of two semimodular gesture sensors.
There are two modules, one is the core module with the controller/MCU, and one is just a peripheral.
Both modules have a gesture sensor on top.
These modules are designed to be positioned next to a keyboard, or in a area where hands are present.
Actions from the hands will be used to provide HID/keyboard input the computer.
Could use for WM management, and simple WASD/Arrow gaming.
